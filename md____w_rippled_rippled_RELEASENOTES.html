Releases</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md319"></a>
Version 1.7.2</h2>
<p>This the 1.7.2 release of rippled, the reference server implementation of the XRP Ledger protocol. This release protects against the security issue <a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20210325.txt">CVE-2021-3499</a> affecting OpenSSL, adds an amendment to fix an issue with small offers not being properly removed from order books in some cases, and includes various other minor fixes. Version 1.7.2 supersedes version 1.7.1 and adds fixes for more issues that were discovered during the release cycle.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md320"></a>
Action Required</h2>
<p>This release introduces a new amendment to the XRP Ledger protocol: <code>fixRmSmallIncreasedQOffers</code>. This amendments is now open for voting according to the XRP Ledger's amendment process, which enables protocol changes following two weeks of &gt;80% support from trusted validators. If you operate an XRP Ledger server, then you should upgrade to version 1.7.2 within two weeks, to ensure service continuity. The exact time that protocol changes take effect depends on the voting decisions of the decentralized network. If you operate an XRP Ledger validator, please learn more about this amendment so you can make informed decisions about how your validator votes. If you take no action, your validator begins voting in favor of any new amendments as soon as it has been upgraded.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md321"></a>
Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>fixRmSmallIncreasedQOffers Amendment:</b> This amendment fixes an issue where certain small offers can be left at the tip of an order book without being consumed or removed when appropriate and causes some payments and Offers to fail when they should have succeeded <a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3827">(#3827)</a>.</li>
<li><b>Adjust OpenSSL defaults and mitigate CVE-2021-3499:</b> Prior to this fix, servers compiled against a vulnerable version of OpenSSL could have a crash triggered by a malicious network connection. This fix disables renegotiation support in OpenSSL so that the rippled server is not vulnerable to this bug regardless of the OpenSSL version used to compile the server. This also removes support for deprecated TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1 and ciphers that are not part of TLS 1.2 <a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3843/commits/79e69da3647019840dca49622621c3d88bc3883f">(#79e69da)</a>.</li>
<li><b>Support HTTP health check in reporting mode:</b> Enables the Health Check special method when running the server in the new Reporting Mode introduced in 1.7.0 <a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3843/commits/9c8caddc5a197bdd642556f8beb14f06d53cdfd3">(9c8cadd)</a>.</li>
<li><b>Maintain compatibility for forwarded RPC responses:</b> Fixes a case in API responses from servers in Reporting Mode, where requests that were forwarded to a P2P-mode server would have the result field nested inside another result field <a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3843/commits/8579eb0c191005022dcb20641444ab471e277f67">(8579eb0)</a>.</li>
<li><b>Add load_factor in reporting mode:</b> Adds a load_factor value to the server info method response when running the server in Reporting Mode so that the response is compatible with the format returned by servers in P2P mode (the default) <a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3843/commits/430802c1cf6d4179f2249a30bfab9eff8e1fa748">(430802c)</a>.</li>
<li><b>Properly encode metadata from tx RPC command:</b> Fixes a problem where transaction metadata in the tx API method response would be in JSON format even when binary was requested <a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3843/commits/73116297aa94c4acbfc74c2593d1aa2323b4cc52">(7311629)</a>.</li>
<li><b>Updates to Windows builds:</b> When building on Windows, use vcpkg 2021 by default and add compatibility with MSVC 2019 <a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3843/commits/36fe1966c3cd37f668693b5d9910fab59c3f8b1f">(36fe196)</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3843/commits/30fd45890b1d3d5f372a2091d1397b1e8e29d2ca">(30fd458)</a>.</li>

New and Improved Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Rework deferred node logic and async fetch behavior:</b> This change significantly improves ledger sync and fetch times while reducing memory consumption. (<a href="https://blog.ripplex.io/how-ripples-c-team-cut-rippleds-memory-footprint-down-to-size/">https://blog.ripplex.io/how-ripples-c-team-cut-rippleds-memory-footprint-down-to-size/</a>)</li>
<li><b>New Ticket feature:</b> Tickets are a mechanism to prepare and send certain transactions outside of the normal sequence order. This version reworks and completes the implementation for Tickets after more than 6 years of development. This feature is now open for voting as the newly-introduced <code>TicketBatch</code> amendment, which replaces the previously-proposed <code>Tickets</code> amendment. The specification for this change can be found at: <a href="https://github.com/xrp-community/standards-drafts/issues/16">xrp-community/standards-drafts#16</a></li>
<li><b>Add Reporting Mode:</b> The server can be compiled to operate in a new mode that serves API requests for validated ledger data without connecting directly to the peer-to-peer network. (The server needs a gRPC connection to another server that is on the peer-to-peer network.) Reporting Mode servers can share access to ledger data via Apache Cassandra and PostgreSQL to more efficiently serve API requests while peer-to-peer servers specialize in broadcasting and processing transactions.</li>
<li><b>Optimize relaying of validation and proposal messages:</b> Servers typically receive multiple copies of any given message from directly connected peers; in particular, consensus proposal and validation messages are often relayed with extremely high redundancy. For servers with several peers, this can cause redundant work. This commit introduces experimental code that attempts to optimize the relaying of proposals and validations by allowing servers to instruct their peers to "squelch" delivery of selected proposals and validations. This change is considered experimental at this time and is disabled by default because the functioning of the consensus network depends on messages propagating with high reliability through the constantly-changing peer-to-peer network. Server operators who wish to test the optimized code can enable it in their server config file.</li>
<li><b>Report server domain to other servers:</b> Server operators now have the option to configure a domain name to be associated with their servers. The value is communicated to other servers and is also reported via the <code>server_info</code> API. The value is meant for third-party applications and tools to group servers together. For example, a tool that visualizes the network's topology can show how many servers are operated by different stakeholders. An operator can claim any domain, so tools should use the <a href="https://xrpl.org/xrp-ledger-toml.html">xrp-ledger.toml file</a> to confirm that the domain also claims ownership of the servers.</li>
<li><b>Improve handling of peers that aren't synced:</b> When evaluating the fitness and usefulness of an outbound peer, the code would incorrectly calculate the amount of time that the peer spent in a non-useful state. This release fixes the calculation and makes the timeout values configurable by server operators. Two new options are introduced in the 'overlay' stanza of the config file.</li>
<li><b>Persist API-configured voting settings:</b> Previously, the amendments that a server would vote in support of or against could be configured both via the configuration file and via the <a href="https://xrpl.org/feature.html">"feature" API method</a>. Changes made in the configuration file were only loaded at server startup; changes made via the command line take effect immediately but were not persisted across restarts. Starting with this release, changes made via the API are saved to the wallet.db database file so that they persist even if the server is restarted. Amendment voting in the config file is deprecated. The first time the server starts with v1.7.0 or higher, it reads any amendment voting settings in the config file and saves the settings to the database; on later restarts the server prints a warning message and ignores the [amendments] and [veto_amendments] stanzas of the config file. Going forward, use the <a href="https://xrpl.org/feature.html">feature method</a> to view and configure amendment votes. If you want to use the config file to configure amendment votes, add a line to the [rpc_startup] stanza such as the following: [rpc_startup] { "command": "feature", "feature": "FlowSortStrands", "vetoed": true }</li>
<li><b>Support UNLs with future effective dates:</b> Updates the format for the recommended validator list file format, allowing publishers to pre-publish the next recommended UNL while the current one is still valid. The server is still backwards compatible with the previous format, but the new format removes some uncertainty during the transition from one list to the next. Also, starting with this release, the server locks down and reports an error if it has no valid validator list. You can clear the error by loading a validator list from a file or by configuring a different UNL and restarting; the error also goes away on its own if the server is able to obtain a trusted validator list from the network (for example, after an network outage resolves itself).</li>
<li><b>Improve manifest relaying:</b> Servers now propagate change messages for validators' ephemeral public keys ("manifests") on a best-effort basis, to make manifests more available throughout the peer-to-peer network. Previously, the server would only relay manifests from validators it trusts locally, which made it difficult to detect and track validators that are not broadly trusted.</li>
<li><b>Implement ledger forward replay feature:</b> The server can now sync up to the network by "playing forward" transactions from a previously saved ledger until it catches up to the network. Compared with the default behavior of fetching the latest state and working backwards, forward replay can save time and bandwidth by reconstructing previous ledgers' state data rather than downloading the pre-calculated results from the network. As an added bonus, forward replay confirms that the rest of the network followed the same transaction processing rules as the local server when processing the intervening ledgers. This feature is considered experimental this time and can be enabled with an option in the config file.</li>
<li><b>Make the transaction job queue limit adjustable:</b> The server uses a job queue to manage tasks, with limits on how many jobs of a particular type can be queued. The previously hard-coded limit associated with transactions is now configurable. Server operators can increase the number of transactions their server is able to queue, which may be useful if your server has a large memory capacity or you expect an influx of transactions. (<a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/issues/3556">https://github.com/ripple/rippled/issues/3556</a>)</li>
<li><b>Add public_key to the Validator List method response:</b> The <a href="https://xrpl.org/validator-list.html">Validator List method</a> can be used to request a recommended validator list from a rippled instance. The response now includes the public key of the requested list. (<a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/issues/3392">https://github.com/ripple/rippled/issues/3392</a>)</li>
<li><b>Server operators can now configure maximum inbound and outbound peers separately:</b> The new <code>peers_in_max</code> and <code>peers_out_max</code> config options allow server operators to independently control the maximum number of inbound and outbound peers the server allows. [70c4ecc]</li>
<li><b>Improvements to shard downloading:</b> Previously the download_shard command could only load shards over HTTPS. Compressed shards can now also be downloaded over plain HTTP. The server fully checks the data for integrity and consistency, so the encryption is not strictly necessary. When initiating multiple shard downloads, the server now returns an error if there is not enough space to store all the shards currently being downloaded.</li>
<li><b>The manifest command is now public:</b> The manifest API method returns public information about a given validator. The required permissions have been changed so it is now part of the public API.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md327"></a>
Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Implement sticky DNS resolution for validator list retrieval:</b> When attempting to load a validator list from a configured site, attempt to reuse the last IP that was successfully used if that IP is still present in the DNS response. (<a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/issues/3494">https://github.com/ripple/rippled/issues/3494</a>).</li>
<li><b>Improve handling of RPC ledger_index argument:</b> You can now provide the <code>ledger_index</code> as a numeric string. This allows you to copy and use the numeric string <code>ledger_index</code> value returned by certain RPC commands. Previously you could only send native JSON numbers or shortcut strings such as "validated" in the <code>ledger_index</code> field. (<a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/issues/3533">https://github.com/ripple/rippled/issues/3533</a>)</li>
<li><b>Fix improper promotion of bool on return</b> [6968da1]</li>
<li><b>Fix ledger sequence on copynode</b> [ef53197]</li>
<li><b>Fix parsing of node public keys in <code>manifest</code> CLI:</b> The previous code attempts to validate the provided node public key using a function that assumes that the encoded public key is for an account. This causes the parsing to fail. This commit fixes #3317 (<a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/issues/3317">https://github.com/ripple/rippled/issues/3317</a>) by letting the caller specify the type of the public key being checked.</li>
<li><b>Fix idle peer timer:</b> Fixes a bug where a function to remove idle peers was called every second instead of every 4 seconds. #3754 (<a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/issues/3754">https://github.com/ripple/rippled/issues/3754</a>)</li>
<li><b>Add database counters:</b> Fix bug where DatabaseRotateImp::getBackend and ::sync utilized the writable backend without a lock. ::getBackend was replaced with ::getCounters.</li>
<li><b>Improve online_delete configuration and DB tuning</b> [6e9051e]</li>
<li><b>Improve handling of burst writes in NuDB database</b> ( <a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3662">https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3662</a> )</li>
<li><b>Fix excessive logging after disabling history shards.</b> Previously if you configured the server with a shard store, then disabled it, the server output excessive warning messages about the shard limit being exceeded.</li>
<li><b>Fixed some issues with negotiating link compression.</b> ( <a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3705">https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3705</a> )</li>
<li><b>Fixed a potential thread deadlock with history sharding.</b> ( <a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3683">https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3683</a> )</li>
<li><b>Various fixes to typos and comments, refactoring, and build system improvements</b></li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md328"></a>
Version 1.6.0</h2>
<p>This release introduces several new features including changes to the XRP Ledger's consensus mechanism to make it even more robust in adverse conditions, as well as numerous bug fixes and optimizations.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md329"></a>
New and Improved Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Initial implementation of Negative UNL functionality: This change can improve the liveness of the network during periods of network instability, by allowing servers to track which validators are temporarily offline and to adjust quorum calculations to match. This change requires an amendment, but the amendment is not in the <b>1.6.0</b> release. Ripple expects to run extensive public testing for Negative UNL functionality on the Devnet in the coming weeks. If public testing satisfies all requirements across security, reliability, stability, and performance, then the amendment could be included in a version 2.0 release. [<a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3380">#3380</a>]</li>
<li>Validation Hardening: This change allows servers to detect accidental misconfiguration of validators, as well as potentially Byzantine behavior by malicious validators. Servers can now log a message to notify operators if they detect a single validator issuing validations for multiple, incompatible ledger versions, or validations from multiple servers sharing a key. As part of this update, validators report the version of <code>rippled</code> they are using, as well as the hash of the last ledger they consider to be fully validated, in validation messages. [<a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3291">#3291</a>] <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Amendment-Required-red" alt="Amendment: Required" class="inline"/></li>
<li>Software Upgrade Monitoring &amp; Notification: After the <code>HardenedValidations</code> amendment is enabled and the validators begin reporting the versions of <code>rippled</code> they are running, a server can check how many of the validators on its UNL run a newer version of the software than itself. If more than 60% of a server's validators are running a newer version, the server writes a message to notify the operator to consider upgrading their software. [<a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3447">#3447</a>]</li>
<li>Link Compression: Beginning with <b>1.6.0</b>, server operators can enable support for compressing peer-to-peer messages. This can save bandwidth at a cost of higher CPU usage. This support is disabled by default and should prove useful for servers with a large number of peers. [<a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3287">#3287</a>]</li>
<li>Unconditionalize Amendments that were enabled in 2017: This change removes legacy code which the network has not used since 2017. This change limits the ability to <a href="https://github.com/xrp-community/standards-drafts/issues/14">replay</a> ledgers that rely on the pre-2017 behavior. [<a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3292">#3292</a>]</li>
<li>New Health Check Method: Perform a simple HTTP request to get a summary of the health of the server: Healthy, Warning, or Critical. [<a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3365">#3365</a>]</li>
<li>Start work on API version 2. Version 2 of the API will be part of a future release. The first breaking change will be to consolidate several closely related error messages that can occur when the server is not synced into a single "notSynced" error message. [<a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3269">#3269</a>]</li>
<li>Improved shard concurrency: Improvements to the shard engine have helped reduce the lock scope on all public functions, increasing the concurrency of the code. [<a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3251">#3251</a>]</li>
<li>Default Port: In the config file, the <code>[ips_fixed]</code> and <code>[ips]</code> stanzas now use the <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml?search=2459">IANA-assigned port</a> for the XRP Ledger protocol (2459) when no port is specified. The <code>connect</code> API method also uses the same port by default. [<a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/2861">#2861</a>].</li>
<li>Improve proposal and validation relaying. The peer-to-peer protocol always relays trusted proposals and validations (as part of the <a href="https://xrpl.org/consensus.html">consensus process</a>), but only relays <em>untrusted</em> proposals and validations in certain circumstances. This update adds configuration options so server operators can fine-tune how their server handles untrusted proposals and validations, and changes the default behavior to prioritize untrusted validations higher than untrusted proposals. [<a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3391">#3391</a>]</li>
<li>Various Build and CI Improvements including updates to RocksDB 6.7.3 [<a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3356">#3356</a>], NuDB 2.0.3 [<a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3437">#3437</a>], adjusting CMake settings so that rippled can be built as a submodule [<a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3449">#3449</a>], and adding Travis CI settings for Ubuntu Bionic Beaver [<a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3319">#3319</a>].</li>
<li>Better documentation in the config file for online deletion and database tuning. [<a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3429">#3429</a>]</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md330"></a>

<ul>
<li>Fix the 14 day timer to enable amendment to start at the correct quorum size [<a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3396">#3396</a>]</li>

<li>Address an issue that can occur during the loading of validator tokens, where a deliberately malformed token could cause the server to crash during startup. [<a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3326">#3326</a>]</li>
<li>Add delivered amount to GetAccountTransactionHistory. The delivered_amount field was not being populated when calling GetAccountTransactionHistory. In contrast, the delivered_amount field was being populated when calling GetTransaction. This change populates delivered_amount in the response to GetAccountTransactionHistory, and adds a unit test to make sure the results delivered by GetTransaction and GetAccountTransactionHistory match each other. [<a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3370">#3370</a>]</li>
<li>Fix build issues for GCC 10 [<a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3393">#3393</a>]</li>
<li>Fix historical ledger acquisition - this fixes an issue where historical ledgers were acquired only since the last online deletion interval instead of the configured value to allow deletion.[<a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3369">#3369</a>]</li>
<li>Fix build issue with Docker <a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3416">#3416</a>]</li>
<li>Add Shard family. The App Family utilizes a single shared Tree Node and Full Below cache for all history shards. This can create a problem when acquiring a shard that shares an account state node that was recently cached from another shard operation. The new Shard Family class solves this issue by managing separate Tree Node and Full Below caches for each shard. <a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/3448">#3448</a>]</li>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md331"></a>
Version 1.5.0</h2>
<p>The <code>rippled</code> 1.5.0 release introduces several improvements and new features, including support for gRPC API, API versioning, UNL propagation via the peer network, new RPC methods <code>validator_info</code> and <code>manifest</code>, augmented <code>submit</code> method, improved <code>tx</code> method response, improved command line parsing, improved handshake protocol, improved package building and various other minor bug fixes and improvements.</p>
<p>This release also introduces two new amendments: <code>fixQualityUpperBound</code> and <code>RequireFullyCanonicalSig</code>.</p>
<p>Several improvements to the sharding system are currently being evaluated for inclusion into the upcoming 1.6 release of <code>rippled</code>. These changes are incompatible with shards generated by previous versions of the code. Additionally, an issue with the existing sharding engine can result in a server running versions 1.4 or 1.5 of the software to experience a deadlock and automatically restart when running with the sharding feature enabled. At this time, the developers recommend running with sharding disabled, pending the improvements scheduled to be introduced with 1.6. For more information on how to disable sharding, please visit <a href="https://xrpl.org/configure-history-sharding.html">https://xrpl.org/configure-history-sharding.html</a></p>
<p><b>New and Updated Features</b></p><ul>
<li>The <code>RequireFullyCanonicalSig</code> amendment which changes the signature requirements for the XRP Ledger protocol so that non-fully-canonical signatures are no longer valid. This protects against transaction malleability on all transactions, instead of just transactions with the tfFullyCanonicalSig flag enabled. Without this amendment, a transaction is malleable if it uses a secp256k1 signature and does not have tfFullyCanonicalSig enabled. Most signing utilities enable tfFullyCanonicalSig by default, but there are exceptions. With this amendment, no single-signed transactions are malleable. (Multi-signed transactions may still be malleable if signers provide more signatures than are necessary.) All transactions must use the fully canonical form of the signature, regardless of the tfFullyCanonicalSig flag. Signing utilities that do not create fully canonical signatures are not supported. All of Ripple's signing utilities have been providing fully-canonical signatures exclusively since at least 2014. For more information. <a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/ec137044a014530263cd3309d81643a5a3c1fdab"><code>ec137044a</code></a></li>
<li>Native <a href="https://grpc.io/">gRPC API</a> support. Currently, this API provides a subset of the full <code>rippled</code> <a href="https://xrpl.org/rippled-api.html">API</a>. You can enable the gRPC API on your server with a new configuration stanza. <a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/7d867b806d70fc41fb45e3e61b719397033b272c"><code>7d867b806</code></a></li>
<li>API Versioning which allows for future breaking change of RPC methods to co-exist with existing versions. <a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commit/2aa11fa41d4a7849ae6a5d7a11df6f367191e3ef"><code>2aa11fa41</code></a></li>

Version 0.50.0</h2>
<p>The <code>rippled</code> 0.50.0 release includes TickSize, which allows gateways to set a "tick size" for assets they issue to help promote faster price discovery and deeper liquidity, as well as reduce transaction spam and ledger churn on RCL. Ripple expects TickSize to be enabled via an Amendment called TickSize on Tuesday, 2017-02-21.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://ripple.com/build/rippled-setup/#updating-rippled">update to the new version</a> on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or CentOS 7 using yum. For other platforms, please <a href="https://wiki.ripple.com/Rippled_build_instructions">compile the new version from source</a>.</p>
<p><b>New and Updated Features</b></p>
<p><b>Tick Size</b></p>
<p>Currently, offers on RCL can differ by as little as one part in a quadrillion. This means that there is essentially no value to placing an offer early, as an offer placed later at a microscopically better price gets priority over it. The <a href="https://ripple.com/build/amendments/#ticksize">TickSize</a> Amendment solves this problem by introducing a minimum tick size that a price must move for an offer to be considered to be at a better price. The tick size is controlled by the issuers of the assets involved.</p>
<p>This change lets issuers quantize the exchange rates of offers to use a specified number of significant digits. Gateways must enable a TickSize on their account for this feature to benefit them. A single AccountSet transaction may set a <code>TickSize</code> parameter. Legal values are 0 and 3-15 inclusive. Zero removes the setting. 3-15 allow that many decimal digits of precision in the pricing of offers for assets issued by this account. It will still be possible to place an offer to buy or sell any amount of an asset and the offer will still keep that amount as exactly as it does now. If an offer involves two assets that each have a tick size, the smaller number of significant figures (larger ticks) controls.</p>
<p>For asset pairs with XRP, the tick size imposed, if any, is the tick size of the issuer of the non-XRP asset. For asset pairs without XRP, the tick size imposed, if any, is the smaller of the two issuer's configured tick sizes.</p>
<p>The tick size is imposed by rounding the offer quality down to the nearest tick and recomputing the non-critical side of the offer. For a buy, the amount offered is rounded down. For a sell, the amount charged is rounded up.</p>
<p>The primary expected benefit of the TickSize amendment is the reduction of bots fighting over the tip of the order book, which means:</p><ul>
<li>Quicker price discovery as outpricing someone by a microscopic amount is made impossible (currently bots can spend hours outbidding each other with no significant price movement)</li>
<li>A reduction in offer creation and cancellation spam</li>
<li>Traders can't outbid by a microscopic amount</li>
<li>More offers left on the books as priority</li>
</ul>
<p>We also expect larger tick sizes to benefit market makers in the following ways:</p><ul>
<li>They increase the delta between the fair market value and the trade price, ultimately reducing spreads</li>
<li>They prevent market makers from consuming each other's offers due to slight changes in perceived fair market value, which promotes liquidity</li>
<li>They promote faster price discovery by reducing the back and forths required to move the price by traders who don't want to move the price more than they need to</li>
<li>They reduce transaction spam by reducing fighting over the tip of the order book and reducing the need to change offers due to slight price changes</li>
<li>They reduce ledger churn and metadata sizes by reducing the number of indexes each order book must have</li>
<li>They allow the order book as presented to traders to better reflect the actual book since these presentations are inevitably aggregated into ticks</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Hardened TLS configuration</b></p>
<p>This release updates the default TLS configuration for rippled. The new release supports only 2048-bit DH parameters and defines a new default set of modern ciphers to use, removing support for ciphers and hash functions that are no longer considered secure.</p>
<p>Server administrators who wish to have different settings can configure custom global and per-port cipher suites in the configuration file using the <code>ssl_ciphers</code> directive.</p>

<p>You can update to the new version on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or CentOS 7 using yum. For other platforms, please compile the new version from source.</p>
<p><b>New and Updated Features</b></p>
<p>Previously, Ripple announced the introduction of Payment Channels during the release of rippled version 0.33.0, which permit scalable, off-ledger checkpoints of high volume, low value payments flowing in a single direction. This was the first step in a multi-phase effort to make RCL more scalable and to support Interledger Protocol (ILP). Ripple expects Payment Channels to be enabled via an Amendment called <a href="https://ripple.com/build/amendments/#paychan">PayChan</a> on a future date to be determined.</p>
<p>In the second phase towards making RCL more scalable and compatible with ILP, Ripple is introducing Suspended Payments, a new transaction type on the Ripple network that functions similar to an escrow service, which permits users to cryptographically escrow XRP on RCL with an expiration date. Ripple expects Suspended Payments to be enabled via an Amendment named <a href="https://ripple.com/build/amendments/#suspay">SusPay</a> on Tuesday, 2017-01-17.</p>
<p>A Suspended Payment can be created, which deducts the funds from the sending account. It can then be either fulfilled or canceled. It can only be fulfilled if the fulfillment transaction makes it into a ledger with a CloseTime lower than the expiry date of the transaction. It can be canceled with a transaction that makes it into a ledger with a CloseTime greater than the expiry date of the transaction.</p>
<p>In the third phase towards making RCL more scalable and compatible with ILP, Ripple plans to introduce additional library support for crypto-conditions, which are distributable event descriptions written in a standard format that describe how to recognize a fulfillment message without saying exactly what the fulfillment is. Fulfillments are cryptographically verifiable messages that prove an event occurred. If you transmit a fulfillment, then everyone who has the condition can agree that the condition has been met. Fulfillment requires the submission of a signature that matches the condition (message hash and public key). This format supports multiple algorithms, including different hash functions and cryptographic signing schemes. Crypto-conditions can be nested in multiple levels, with each level possibly having multiple signatures.</p>

<p>A fixed version of the new payment processing engine, which we initially announced on Friday, 2016-07-29, is expected to be available via Amendment on Wednesday, 2016-10-20 with the name <a href="https://ripple.com/build/amendments/#flow">Flow</a>.

<p>The Flow code may occasionally produce slightly different results than the old payment processing engine due to the effects of floating point rounding.</p>
<p>We will be introducing changes to the hash tree structure that rippled uses to represent a ledger, which we expect to be activated via Amendment on a future date (TBA) with the name <a href="https://ripple.com/build/amendments/#shamapv2">SHAMapV2</a>. The new structure is more compact and efficient than the previous version. This affects how ledger hashes are calculated, but has no other user-facing consequences. The activation of the SHAMapV2 amendment will require brief scheduled allowable downtime, while the changes to the hash tree structure are propagated by the network. We will keep the community updated as we progress towards this date (TBA).</p>
<p>In an effort to make RCL more scalable and to support Interledger Protocol (ILP) trust lines as balances get more substantial, we’re introducing XRP Payment Channels, a new structure in the ledger, which we expect to be available via Amendment on a future date (TBA) with the name <a href="https://ripple.com/build/amendments/#paychan">PayChan</a>.</p>
<p>XRP Payment Channels permit scalable, intermittent, off-ledger settlement of ILP trust lines for high volume payments flowing in a single direction. For bidirectional channels, an XRP Payment Channel can be used in each direction. The recipient can claim any unpaid balance at any time. The owner can top off the channel as needed. The owner must wait out a delay to close the channel to give the recipient a chance to supply any claims. The total amount paid increases monotonically as newer claims are issued.</p>
<p>The initial concept behind payment channels was discussed as early as 2011 and the first implementation was done by Mike Hearn in bitcoinj. Recent work being done by Lightning Network has showcased examples of the many use cases for payment channels. The introduction of XRP Payment Channels allows for a more efficient integration between RCL and ILP to further support enterprise use cases for high volume payments.</p>

Version 0.32.1</h2>
<p>The <code>rippled</code> 0.32.1 release includes an improved version of the payment code, which we expect to be available via Amendment on Wednesday, 2016-08-24 with the name FlowV2, and a completely new implementation of the WebSocket protocol for serving clients.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://ripple.com/build/rippled-setup/#updating-rippled">update to the new version</a> on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or CentOS 7 using yum. For other platforms, please <a href="https://wiki.ripple.com/Rippled_build_instructions">compile the new version from source</a>.</p>
<p><b>New and Updated Features</b></p>
<p>An improved version of the payment processing engine, which we expect to be available via Amendment on Wednesday, 2016-08-24 with the name “FlowV2”. The new payments code adds no new features, but improves efficiency and robustness in payment handling.</p>
<p>The FlowV2 code may occasionally produce slightly different results than the old payment processing engine due to the effects of floating point rounding. Once FlowV2 is enabled on the network then old servers without the FlowV2 amendment will lose sync more frequently because of these differences.</p>
<p><b>Beast WebSocket</b></p>
<p>A completely new implementation of the WebSocket protocol for serving clients is available as a configurable option for <code>rippled</code> administrators. To enable this new implementation, change the “protocol” field in <code>rippled.cfg</code> from “ws” to “ws2” (or from “wss” to “wss2” for Secure WebSockets), as illustrated in this example: </p><pre class="fragment">[port_ws_public]
port = 5006
ip = 0.0.0.0
protocol = wss2
</pre><p>The new implementation paves the way for increased reliability and future performance when submitting commands over WebSocket. The behavior and syntax of commands should be identical to the previous implementation. Please report any issues to <a href="#" onclick="location.href='mai'+'lto:'+'sup'+'po'+'rt@'+'ri'+'ppl'+'e.'+'com'; return false;">suppo<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>rt@r<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>ipple<span style="display: none;">.nosp@m.</span>.com</a>. A future version of rippled will remove the old WebSocket implementation, and use only the new one.</p>
<p><b>Bug fixes</b></p>
<p>Fix a non-exploitable, intermittent crash in some client pathfinding requests (RIPD-1219)</p>
<p>Fix a non-exploitable crash caused by a race condition in the HTTP server. (RIPD-1251)</p>
<p>Fix bug that could cause a previously fee queued transaction to not be relayed after being in the open ledger for an extended time without being included in a validated ledger. Fix bug that would allow an account to have more than the allowed limit of transactions in the fee queue. Fix bug that could crash debug builds in rare cases when replacing a dropped transaction. (RIPD-1200)</p>
<p>Remove incompatible OS X switches in Test.py (RIPD-1250)</p>
<p>Autofilling a transaction fee (sign / submit) with the experimental <code>x-queue-okay</code> parameter will use the user’s maximum fee if the open ledger fee is higher, improving queue position, and giving the tx more chance to succeed. (RIPD-1194)</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md364"></a>
Version 0.32.0</h2>
<p>The <code>rippled</code> 0.32.0 release improves transaction queue which now supports batching and can hold up to 10 transactions per account, allowing users to queue multiple transactions for processing when the network load is high. Additionally, the <code>server_info</code> and <code>server_state</code> commands now include information on transaction cost multipliers and the fee command is available to unprivileged users. We advise rippled operators to upgrade immediately.</p>
<p>You can update to the new version on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or CentOS 7 using yum. For other platforms, please compile the new version from source.</p>

<p><b>Release Overview</b></p>
<p>As part of Ripple Labs’ ongoing commitment toward protocol security, the rippled team would like to release rippled 0.30.0.</p>
<p><b>Toolchain support</b></p>
<p>The minimum supported version of GCC used to compile rippled is v4.8. Please follow <a href="https://wiki.ripple.com/Ubuntu_build_instructions#Ubuntu_versions_older_than_13.10_:_Install_gcc_4.8">these instructions</a> if you have not upgraded already.</p>
<p>While it may be possible to compile rippled on (virtual) machines with 4GB of RAM, we recommend compiling on (virtual) machines with 8GB of RAM or more. If your build machine has more than one CPU (**&lsquo;grep &rsquo;^processor' /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l<code>**), you can use them to assist in the build process by compiling with the command **</code>scons -j[number of CPUs - 1]`**.</p>
<p><b>New Features</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Honor markers in ledger_data requests (<a href="https://ripplelabs.atlassian.net/browse/RIPD-1010">RIPD-1010</a>).</li>
<li>New Amendment - <b>TrustSetAuth</b> (Not currently enabled) Create zero balance trust lines with auth flag (<a href="https://ripplelabs.atlassian.net/browse/RIPD-1003">RIPD-1003</a>): this allows a TrustSet transaction to create a trust line if the only thing being changed is setting the tfSetfAuth flag.</li>
<li>Randomize the initial transaction execution order for closed ledgers based on the hash of the consensus set (<a href="https://ripplelabs.atlassian.net/browse/RIPD-961">RIPD-961</a>). <b>Activates on October 27, 2015 at 11:00 AM PCT</b>.</li>

    Set version to 0.28.0
</pre><p>This release incorporates a number of important features, bugfixes and functional improvements. Please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commits/0.28.0">Git commit history</a> for more detailed information.</p>
<p><b>Release Overview</b></p>
<p>As part of Ripple Labs’ ongoing commitment toward improving the protocol, the rippled team is excited to announce <b>autobridging</b> — a feature that allows XRP to serve as a bridge currency. Autobridging enhances utility and has the potential to expose more of the network to liquidity and improve prices. For more information please refer to the <a href="https://ripple.com/uncategorized/introducing-offer-autobridging/">autobridging blog post</a>.</p>
<p><b>Toolchain support</b></p>
<p>The minimum supported version of GCC used to compile rippled is v4.8. Please follow <a href="https://wiki.ripple.com/Ubuntu_build_instructions#Ubuntu_versions_older_than_13.10_:_Install_gcc_4.8">these instructions</a> if you have not upgraded already.</p>
<p>While it may be possible to compile rippled on (virtual) machines with 4GB of RAM, we recommend compiling on (virtual) machines with 8GB of RAM or more. If your build machine has more than one CPU (**`grep '^processor' /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l`**), you can use them to assist in the build process by compiling with the command <b>scons -j[number of CPUs - 1]</b>.</p>
<p>The minimum supported version of Boost is v1.57.0. You <b>must</b> upgrade to this release or later to successfully compile this release of rippled. Please follow <a href="https://wiki.ripple.com/Ubuntu_build_instructions#Install_Boost">these instructions</a> if you have not upgraded already.</p>
<p><b>Important rippled.cfg update</b></p>
<p>With rippled version 0.28, the rippled.cfg file must be changed according to these instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change any entries that say</li>
</ul>
<p><code>admin</code> <code>=</code> <code>allow</code> to <code>admin</code> <code>=</code> &lt;IP address&gt;</p>
<ul>
<li>For most installations, 127.0.0.1 will preserve current behavior. 0.0.0.0 may be specified to indicate "any IP" but cannot be combined with other IP addresses. Use of 0.0.0.0 may introduce severe security risks and is not recommended. See docs/rippled-example.cfg for more information.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>More Strict Requirements on MemoType</b></p>
<p>The requirements on the contents of the MemoType field, if present, are more strict than the previous version. Transactions that can successfully be submitted to 0.27.4 and earlier may fail in 0.28.0. For details, please refer to <a href="https://ripple.com/build/transactions/#memos">updated memo documentation</a> for details. Partners should check their implementation to make sure that their MemoType follows the new rules.</p>
<p><b>New Features</b></p>

     Set version to 0.27.0
</pre><p>This release incorporates a number of important bugfixes and functional improvements. Please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/ripple/rippled/commits/0.27.0">Git commit history</a> for more detailed information.</p>
<p><b>Release Overview</b></p>
<p>The rippled team is proud to release rippled 0.27.0. This new version includes many exciting features that will appeal to our users. The team continues to work on stability, scalability, and performance.</p>
<p>The first feature is Online Delete. This feature allows rippled to maintain it’s database of previous ledgers within a fixed amount of disk space. It does this while allowing rippled to stay online and maintain an administrator specify minimum number of ledgers. This means administrators with limited disk space will no longer need to manage disk space by periodically manually removing the database. Also, with the previously existing backend databases performance would gradually degrade as the database grew in size. In particular, rippled would perform poorly whenever the backend database performed ever growing compaction operations. By limiting rippled to less history, compaction is less resource intensive and systems with less disk performance can now run rippled.</p>
<p>Additionally, we are very excited to include Universal Port. This feature allows rippled's listening port to handshake in multiple protocols. For example, a single listening port can be configured to receive incoming peer connections, incoming RPC commands over HTTP, and incoming RPC commands over HTTPS at the same time. Or, a single port can receive both Websockets and Secure Websockets clients at the same.</p>
<p>Finally, a new, experimental backend database, NuDB, has been added. This database was developed by Ripple Labs to take advantage of rippled’s specific data usage profile and performs much better than previous databases. Significantly, this database does not degrade in performance as the database grows. Very excitingly, this database works on OS X and Windows. This allows rippled to use these platforms for the first time.</p>
<p><b>Toolchain support</b></p>
<p>The minimum supported version of GCC used to compile rippled is v4.8. Please follow <a href="https://wiki.ripple.com/Ubuntu_build_instructions#Ubuntu_versions_older_than_13.10_:_Install_gcc_4.8">these instructions</a> if you have not upgraded already.</p>
<p>While it may be possible to compile rippled on (virtual) machines with 4GB of RAM, we recommend compiling on (virtual) machines with 8GB of RAM or more. If your build machine has more than one CPU (**`grep '^processor' /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l`**), you can use them to assist in the build process by compiling with the command <b>scons -j[number of CPUs - 1]</b>.</p>
<p>The minimum supported version of Boost is v1.57.0. You <b>must</b> upgrade to this release or later to successfully compile this release of rippled. Please follow <a href="https://wiki.ripple.com/Ubuntu_build_instructions#Install_Boost">these instructions</a> if you have not upgraded already.</p>
<p><b>Important rippled.cfg Update</b></p>
<p><b>The format of the configuration file has changed. If upgrading from a previous version of rippled, please see the migration instructions below.</b></p>
<p><b>New Features</b></p>

</ul>
<p><b>Development-Related Updates</b></p>
<ul>
<li>HTTP Handshaking for Peers on Universal Port (<a href="https://ripplelabs.atlassian.net/browse/RIPD-446">RIPD-446</a>)</li>

<li>Option to specify rippled path on command line (&ndash;rippled=&lt;absolute or relative path&gt;)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Experimental</b></p>
<ul>
<li>NuDB backend option: high performance key/value database optimized for rippled (set “type=nudb” in .cfg)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Migration Instructions</b></p>
<p>With rippled version 0.27.0, the rippled.cfg file must be changed according to these instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add new stanza - <code>[server]</code>. This section will contain a list of port names and key/value pairs. A port name must start with a letter and contain only letters and numbers. The name is not case-sensitive. For each name in this list, rippled will look for a configuration file section with the same name and use it to create a listening port. To simplify migration, you can use port names from your previous version of rippled.cfg (see Section 1. Server for detailed explanation in doc/rippled-example.cfg). For example: <pre class="fragment"> [server]
 rpc_port
 peer_port
 websocket_port
 ssl_key = &lt;set value to your current [rpc_ssl_key] or [websocket_ssl_key] setting&gt;
 ssl_cert = &lt;set value to your current [rpc_ssl_cert] or [websocket_ssl_cert] setting&gt;
 ssl_chain = &lt;set value to your current [rpc_ssl_chain] or [websocket_ssl_chain] setting&gt;
</pre></li>
<li>For each port name in <code>[server]</code> stanza, add separate stanzas. For example: <pre class="fragment"> [rpc_port]
 port = &lt;set value to your current [rpc_port] setting, usually 5005&gt;
 ip = &lt;set value to your current [rpc_ip] setting, usually 127.0.0.1&gt;
 admin = allow
 protocol = https

 [peer_port]
 port = &lt;set value to your current [peer_port], usually 51235&gt;
 ip = &lt;set value to your current [peer_ip], usually 0.0.0.0&gt;
 protocol = peer

 [websocket_port]
 port = &lt;your current [websocket_port], usually 6006&gt;
 ip = &lt;your current [websocket_ip], usually 127.0.0.1&gt;
 admin = allow
 protocol = wss
</pre></li>
<li>Remove current <code>[rpc_port],</code> <code>[rpc_ip],</code> <code>[rpc_allow_remote],</code> <code>[rpc_ssl_key],</code> <code>[rpc_ssl_cert],</code> <code>and</code> <code>[rpc_ssl_chain],</code> <code>[peer_port],</code> <code>[peer_ip],</code> <code>[websocket_port],</code> <code>[websocket_ip]</code> settings from rippled.cfg</li>
<li>If you allow untrusted websocket connections to your rippled, add <code>[websocket_public_port]</code> stanza under <code>[server]</code> section and replace websocket public settings with <code>[websocket_public_port]</code> section: <pre class="fragment"> [websocket_public_port]
 port = &lt;your current [websocket_public_port], usually 5005&gt;
 ip = &lt;your current [websocket_public_ip], usually 127.0.0.1&gt;
 protocol = ws ← make sure this is ws, not wss`
</pre></li>
<li>Remove <code>[websocket_public_port],</code> <code>[websocket_public_ip],</code> <code>[websocket_ssl_key],</code> <code>[websocket_ssl_cert],</code> <code>[websocket_ssl_chain]</code> settings from rippled.cfg</li>
<li>Disable <code>[ssl_verify]</code> section by setting it to 0</li>
<li>Migrate the remaining configurations without changes. To enable online delete feature, check Section 6. Database in doc/rippled-example.cfg</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Integration Notes</b></p>
<p>With this release, integrators should deprecate the "DeliveredAmount" field in favor of "delivered\_amount."</p>
<p><b>For Transactions That Occurred Before January 20, 2014:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>If amount actually delivered is different than the transactions “Amount” field<ul>
<li>"delivered\_amount" will show as unavailable indicating a developer should use caution when processing this payment.</li>
<li>Example: A partial payment transaction (tfPartialPayment).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Otherwise<ul>
<li>"delivered\_amount" will show the correct destination balance change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>For Transactions That Occur After January 20, 2014:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>If amount actually delivered is different than the transactions “Amount” field<ul>
<li>A "delivered\_amount" field will determine the destination amount change</li>
<li>Example: A partial payment transaction (tfPartialPayment).</li>

</pre><p><b>RocksDB back end</b></p>
<p>RocksDB is based on LevelDB with improvements from Facebook and the community. Preliminary tests show that it stalls less often than HyperLevelDB for our use cases.</p>
<p>If you are switching over from an existing back end, you have two options. You can remove your old database and let rippled recreate it as it re-syncs, or you can import your old database into the new one.</p>
<p>To remove your old database, make sure the server is shut down (`rippled stop`). Remove the <em>db/ledger.db</em> and <em>db/transaction.db</em> files. Remove all the files in your back end store directory (<em>db/hashnode</em> by default). Then change your configuration file to use the RocksDB back end and restart.</p>
<p>To import your old database, start by shutting the server down. Then modify the configuration file by renaming your *[node_db]* stanza to *[import_db]*. Create a new *[node_db]* stanza and specify a RocksDB back end with a different directory. Start the server with the command <b>rippled &ndash;import</b>. When the import finishes gracefully stop the server (`rippled stop`). Please wait for rippled to stop on its own because it can take several minutes for it to shut down after an import. Remove the old database, put the new database into place, remove the *[import_db]* section, change the *[node_db]* section to refer to the final location, and restart the server.</p>
<p>The recommended RocksDB configuration is: </p><pre class="fragment"> [node_db]
 type=RocksDB
 path=db/hashnode

 filter_bits=12
 cache_mb=128
 file_size_mb=8

</pre><p><b>Configuring your Node DB</b></p>
<p>You need to configure the <a href="https://wiki.ripple.com/NodeBackEnd">NodeBackEnd</a> that you want the server to use. See above for an example RocksDB configuration.</p>

<p>To import your old database, start by shutting the server down. Then modify the configuration file by renaming your <code>[node_db]</code> portion to <code>[import_db]</code>. Create a new <code>[node_db]</code> section specify a RocksDB back end and a different directory. Start the server with <code>rippled --import</code>. When the import finishes, stop the server (it can take several minutes to shut down after an import), remove the old database, put the new database into place, remove the <code>[import_db]</code> section, change the <code>[node_db]</code> section to refer to the final location, and restart the server.</p>
<p>The recommended RocksDB configuration is: </p><pre class="fragment">[node_db]
type=RocksDB
path=db/hashnode
open_files=1200
filter_bits=12
cache_mb=256
file_size_mb=8
file_size_mult=2
</pre><p><b>Configuring your Node DB</b></p>
<p>You need to configure the <a href="https://wiki.ripple.com/NodeBackEnd">NodeBackEnd</a> that you want the server to use. See above for an example RocksDB configuration.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Note:</b> HyperLevelDB and RocksDB are not available on Windows platform.</li>

Author: JoelKatz &lt;DavidJoelSchwartz@GMail.com&gt;
Date:   Mon Aug 26 12:08:05 2013 -0700

    Set version to v0.12.0
</pre><p><b>Major Partner Issues Fixed</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Server Showing "Offline"</li>
</ul>
<p>This issue was caused by LevelDB periodically compacting its internal data structure. While compacting, rippled's processing would stall causing the node to lose sync with the rest of the network. This issue was solved by switching from LevelDB to HyperLevelDB. rippled operators will need to change their ripple.cfg file. See below for configuration details.</p>
<ul>
<li>Premature Validation of Transactions</li>
</ul>
<p>On rare occasions, a transaction would show as locally validated before the full network consensus was confirmed. This issue was resolved by changing the way transactions are saved.</p>
<ul>
<li>Missing Ledgers</li>
</ul>
<p>Occasionally, some rippled servers would fail to fetch all ledgers. This left gaps in the local history and caused some API calls to report incomplete results. The ledger fetch code was rewritten to both prevent this and to repair any existing gaps.</p>
<p><b>Significant Changes</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The way transactions are saved has been changed. This fixes a number of ways transactions can incorrectly be reported as fully-validated.</li>
<li><code>doTransactionEntry</code> now works against open ledgers.</li>
<li><code>doLedgerEntry</code> now supports a binary option.</li>
<li>A bug in <code>getBookPage</code> that caused it to skip offers is fixed.</li>
<li><code>getNodeFat</code> now returns deeper chains, reducing ledger acquire latency.</li>
<li>Catching up if the (published ledger stream falls behind the network) is now more aggressive.</li>
<li>I/O stalls are drastically reduced by using the HyperLevelDB node back end.</li>
<li>Persistent ledger gaps should no longer occur.</li>
<li>Clusters now exchange load information.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Validators</b></p>
<p>Ripple Labs is now running five validators. You can use this template for your <code>validators.txt</code> file:</p>
<p><strike> </p><pre class="fragment">[validators]

<p><b>Release Candidates</b></p>
<p>RC1 was the first release candidate.</p>
<p>RC2 fixed a bug that could cause ledger acquires to stall.</p>
<p>RC3 fixed compilation under OSX.</p>
<p>RC4 includes performance improvements in countAccountTx and numerous small fixes to ledger acquisition.</p>
<p>RC5 changed the peer low water mark from 4 to 10 to acquire more server connections.</p>
<p>RC6 fixed some possible load issues with the network state timer and cluster reporting timers.</p>
<p><b>Issues</b></p>
<p>Fetching of historical ledgers is slower in this build than in previous builds. This is being investigated. </p>
